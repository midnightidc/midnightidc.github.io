To start of my first post, I think I'll start with my (maybe) unpopular opinions!

first off, 

## just because an addiction/obsession is centered around a somewhat healthy thing doesn't mean it's good

I think that one's self explanitory, obsessions can very easily spiral into something worse or potentially dangerous for them and/or the people around them. Which is, to say the least, very not good!

## 2 If you say you hate or love something another person disagrees with, a you should specify why (In the middle of a talk about that)

So like this one's a bit complicated to explain, but specifically if the other person is talking about it, there's no harm in explaining yourself on the norm
But honestly out of sorta curiosity and some other reasons I couldn't really name, I think if you cut into a conversation to share an opposing opinion you should share why.
If you're really upset with the topic though, hear me out, just dont join the conversation!

## shaming people for liking certain things or doing certain things is a big NONO!!

this is obviously, ignoring illegal things, and moral things that I will probably mention later, as I will not get into morals this early on, YKWIM.
But other than that, shaming people for liking cringe thing/doing cringe things is unneccesary! if you dont like it, look away and dont say anything, nobodies making you listen to them or like what they like!!

yeah that's like it I think!!

Bye Bye!!!!!!!!!1
