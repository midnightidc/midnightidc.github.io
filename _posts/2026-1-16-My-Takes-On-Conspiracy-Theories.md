## 1. ALIEN UFOS
honestly, I think that with the size of the universe and it's rapid expansions, we aren't the only sentient species to exists, but like, UFO's are like a wayy different brands
Another science class story, our teacher saw a UFO? there was a bright light that moved irreguarly before it upped out and disappeared?
Like I respect my science teacher but UFOs are just crazy... I can't even try to believe in that stuff irl

## 2. The earth is flat
Horrible take, we have so much information to disprove this and combat it, why can't you open your eyes to the moon's formation, gravity, even the way water flows
Like, I lowk feel like saying that whoever is saying this is crazy uneducated and that's being polite

## 3. The megalodon still exists deep underground
Woah... That's crazy. I've stated this before as someone who loves marine animals (most of them) (some are freaky okay..?)

Megalodons cannot exist in deep waters due to the amount of energy needed to power them and keep them warm, in fact all of them died out early on due to famine, the only survivors of a famine are reatures that can go a long time without food, ergo smaller animals.
They just simply cannot exist in the deep dark due to the lack of life down there, if they were to live somewhere it'd be in coral reefs or anywhere where pray is bountiful and plenty.

Yeah I just needed to post *something...*

So that's all from me
