So first off, our class recently have gotten in trouble because the guys in our class have started throwing paper balls at each other- something so infantile that it was one of the things, I not belived them to do.
Not only have they started throwing paper balls at each other, they've started to throw it at people entirely uninvolved and refused to take action for it, e.g. apologizing.
So in the end, our class is how in behaviour points.

On the other side, our science teacher doesn't believe in the moon landing, and honestly, while I'm neutral on that matter, our science teacher had very strong points, proven through him successfully convincing my classmates
I still remain neutral.

our seats got rearranged and I got sat with the two people who never have any of their school supplies, I also got sat with someone who thinks telling me the answers to every long math problem is funny.
No.
Let me work it out.

Yeah that's like it

I would say you are "fairly tolerable" and then proceeds to propose to you 2 times.
