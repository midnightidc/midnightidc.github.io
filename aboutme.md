Hi hi!! I'm going by the name of 'A' on here because i really like the letter A, along with many other reasons I dont care to share!
Here's some fun facts about me

- I really like Greek Mythology, Moray eels and reading!!
- I have a really bad habit of collecting notebooks and never using them...
- I have 2 cats, they shed alot but they're really cute trust!!

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now... so maybe ask me later!
